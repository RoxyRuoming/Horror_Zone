            </div>

            <p className="home-text">The adrenaline rush: When watching a horror movie or reading a horror book, 
            our bodies go into fight-or-flight mode, which releases adrenaline and causes our heart rate to increase. 
            This physical response can be addictive for some people, as it gives them a sense of excitement and thrill 
            that they may not experience in their everyday lives.</p>

            <p className="home-text">The feeling of being scared in a safe environment: Watching a horror movie 
            or reading a horror book allows us to experience fear in a controlled environment. We know that we 
            are not in real danger, but we can still feel scared and excited. This can be a cathartic experience 
            for some people, as it allows them to release pent-up emotions in a safe way.</p>

            <p className="home-text">The appeal of the unknown: Horror often deals with the unknown and the supernatural, 
            which can be intriguing to many people. The idea of exploring the mysteries of the world and uncovering secrets 
            that are hidden from us can be very appealing. Additionally, horror can provide a sense of escapism, 
            allowing us to step into a world that is different from our own and experience something new and exciting.</p>
